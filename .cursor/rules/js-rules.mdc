# Your rule content

- You can @ files here
- You can use markdown but dont have to

## Restraints
- Never create new directories or packages unless specifically asked
    - You may create classes but use the existing project structure

## Logic
- When implementing new features always take the smallest technical steps possible
- Never assume your implementations are correct
    - Always provide logs and test criteria for the user to perform to verify the changes worked as intended

## Casing
- All variables local to the class must be snake case
- All function names should be snake case
