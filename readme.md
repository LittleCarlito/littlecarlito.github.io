## üõ†Ô∏è Development Workflow

The monorepo is powered by Lerna for package versioning/publishing and PNPM for fast, disk-space efficient package management.

### Common Commands

```bash
# Start development server for all apps and packages
pnpm dev

# Build all packages and apps
pnpm build

# Clean all build outputs
pnpm clean

# Run linting
pnpm lint

# Format code with Prettier
pnpm fmt

# Run tests
pnpm test
```

## üìù Versioning System

This project uses [Lerna](https://lerna.js.org/) and [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) for automated versioning and publishing.

### Commit Message Format

We follow the conventional commits specification with some custom extensions:

```
<type>([scope]): <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

### Commit Types

We support the following commit types:

- `feat`: A new feature (minor version bump)
- `fix`: A bug fix (patch version bump)
- `refactor`: Code changes that neither fix bugs nor add features (patch version bump)
- `perf`: Performance improvements (patch version bump)
- `docs`: Documentation only changes (no version bump)
- `style`: Changes that don't affect code functionality (no version bump)
- `test`: Adding or correcting tests (no version bump)
- `chore`: Changes to build process or auxiliary tools (no version bump)
- `ci`: Changes to CI configuration files and scripts (no version bump)
- `build`: Changes that affect the build system (no version bump)
- `revert`: Reverts a previous commit (depends on the reverted commit)
- `slice`: Small, incremental changes (patch version bump)

### Special Scopes

- `(pipeline)`: When this scope is used, the commit is ignored for version bumping regardless of type

### Version Bumping Rules

- **Major (x.0.0)**: Any commit with a `BREAKING CHANGE` footer
- **Minor (0.x.0)**: `feat` type commits
- **Patch (0.0.x)**: `fix`, `refactor`, `perf`, and `slice` type commits

### Versioning Mode

This project uses **independent versioning** mode in Lerna, which means:

- Each package maintains its own version number
- Only packages explicitly mentioned in commit scopes or those that depend on changed packages get bumped
- Different packages can have different version numbers

To change to fixed/lockstep versioning (where all packages share the same version), you would change `"version": "independent"` to a specific version number in lerna.json.

### Lerna Commands

```bash
# Check which packages have changed since the last release
pnpm lerna:changed

# Bump versions based on commit messages
pnpm lerna:version [--no-push]

# Publish packages to npm registry
pnpm lerna:publish

# Show differences between packages
pnpm lerna:diff
```

## üöÄ Deployment

The site is automatically deployed to GitHub Pages through a sophisticated CI/CD pipeline:

- **Build Optimization** - Advanced bundling and tree-shaking
- **Asset Processing** - Automatic compression and optimization
- **Parallel Deployment** - Multiple environments for testing
- **Performance Regression Testing** - Automated benchmarks
- **Lighthouse Integration** - Score tracking and improvement suggestions
