pnpm dev

# Build all packages and apps
pnpm build

# Clean all build outputs
pnpm clean

## üîç Architecture Deep Dive

### Performance Optimization

The tooling suite implements several advanced techniques for performance:

- **Custom WebGL State Management** - Minimizes expensive state changes
- **Geometry Instancing** - Reduces draw calls for repeated objects
- **Worker Thread Processing** - Offloads heavy calculations
- **GPU-Accelerated Physics** - Utilizes compute shaders where available
- **Texture Streaming** - Progressive loading of high-resolution textures
- **Shader Permutation Management** - Optimizes shader variants

### Memory Management

Careful attention to memory usage ensures stable performance:

- **Asset Reference Counting** - Automatic cleanup of unused resources
- **Texture Compression** - Automatic format selection based on support
- **Geometry Simplification** - Dynamic LOD based on camera distance
- **Deferred Asset Loading** - Only load what's needed when it's needed
- **Memory Pool Allocation** - Reduces garbage collection pauses

## üöÄ Deployment

The site is automatically deployed to GitHub Pages through a sophisticated CI/CD pipeline:

- **Build Optimization** - Advanced bundling and tree-shaking
- **Asset Processing** - Automatic compression and optimization
- **Parallel Deployment** - Multiple environments for testing
- **Performance Regression Testing** - Automated benchmarks

## Versioning

This project uses [Changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) for version management. When making changes that should result in a version bump:

1. Make your changes
2. Run `pnpm change` to create a changeset
3. Commit the generated changeset file along with your changes
4. Create a PR with your changes

When your PR is merged to main, a "Version Packages" PR will be automatically created. When that PR is merged, packages will be automatically published to GitHub Packages.

See [Changesets Documentation](./documentation/changesets.md) for more details.

## GitHub Actions Workflows

This repository uses several GitHub Actions workflows:

1. **Unified Pipeline** (primary) - Runs on every push to main
   - Builds and tests packages
   - Automatically versions and publishes packages when changesets are present
   - Handles GitHub Pages deployments
   - Fully automated - no manual intervention required

2. **Changesets** - Manual workflow for creating releases
   - Only runs when manually triggered 
   - Not needed for normal workflow as unified pipeline handles publishing

3. **Release/Prerelease** - For specific/beta releases
   - Only run when manually triggered
   - For special release scenarios

**Note:** If you see multiple workflows running in parallel after a merge to main, it may include GitHub's default Pages deployment alongside our custom workflow. This is expected behavior.

For more details, see [documentation/changesets.md](documentation/changesets.md).
