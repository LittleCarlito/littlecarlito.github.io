# This workflow runs tests and checks for PRs.
# IMPORTANT BEHAVIOR NOTE:
# This workflow intentionally displays using the original PR title (first commit message).
# This works in conjunction with the Auto PR workflow which shows the latest commit message,
# giving visibility to both the initial PR intent and current work status.
# DO NOT "fix" this behavior - it's a useful feature for tracking work progress.
